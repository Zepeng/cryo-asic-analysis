## Notebooks space
The intention of this folder is to have a place for development of jupyter notebooks for producing a standard set of plots (or nonstandard); examples of usage of class structures above; etc. 

If you are looking to develop a draft-level notebook code, or using notebooks to develop additional features into the class structure, please look to the scratch folder.
