#This is a second configuration file to map tiles in a multi-tile
#situation. This allows one to convert from local strip coordinates
#to global strip coordinates, based on a tile ID number found in the
#channel_map file. It also is a quick way to look up the location and
#ID of tiles.
#"Tile": ID of the tile, that matches the channel map
#"X/Y": the global position of the center of the tile, within an assembly. (currently, mm)
